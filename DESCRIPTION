Description: 
    Provides a C++ implementation of the Recursive Modified Pattern Search on the Simplex (RMPSS) 
    optimization algorithm. This function is designed for high-dimensional constrained optimization 
    problems where the solution lies in the probability simplex. The user provides an objective 
    function from R, and the C++ routine handles non-convex optimization using systematic coordinate-wise 
    positive and negative movements. Implemented purely in C++ with Rcpp for seamless R integration.
