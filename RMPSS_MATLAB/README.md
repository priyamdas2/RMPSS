## Files

- **`RMPSS.m`**  
  Implements Recursive Modified Pattern Search on the simplex **without parallel threading**.

- **`RMPSS_parallel.m`**  
  Implements Recursive Modified Pattern Search on the simplex **with parallel threading**.

## Notes

In this particular example, the objective function is **not computationally expensive**.  
As a result, the parallel version (`RMPSS_parallel.m`) **may take more time** than the single-threaded version due to the overhead of parallelization.
